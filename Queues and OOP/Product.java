// Note that Product implements the two interfaces shown below.  As you
// know the Comparable interface contains the single method compareTo(),
// as shown below.  However, there are no explicit methods that need to 
// be implemented for the Serializable interface -- in this case it is
// simply a tag that indicates that the class can be read and written
// using the readObject() and writeObject() methods.  Interface
// implementations are inherited, so you do not have to implement these
// in any of your subclasses.
